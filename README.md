# Supervised Learning
## Overview
This repository runs clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. The 2 clustering algorithms that run are K-means and Expectation Maximization. The 4 dimensionality reduction algorithms that run are Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Random Projection (RP) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). This repository runs the following and captures performance:
1.	Runs the 2 clustering Algorithms
2.	Run Dimensionality Reduction and then Clustering Algorithms
3.	Neural Network with Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering Algorithms

Datasets were Adult and Wine data sets from UCI machine learning repository.
## Steps to Run
1. Requires Python 3.6
2. Install following requirements from requirements.txt
2. Run following files with python 3 to create the data files
* run_experiment.py
* UnSupervisedLearning_abalone.py
* UnSupervisedLearning_white_wine_quality.py
